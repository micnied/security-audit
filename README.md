# Security Audit
# Conducting a security audit for Botium Toys - a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys.
# The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture. 
# The task of this project is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment. Then, perform an internal audit to complete a controls assessment and compliance checklist. 
# Results:
# I reviewed the scope of the audit then considered risks to Botium Toys’ customers, employees, and assets.
# I selected and rated each of the controls you selected to determine if they need to be implemented immediately or in the future.
# I selected compliance regulations and standards that Botium Toys needs to adhere to and explained why.
